# **Fuel Price Analysis & Forecasting**

## **Project Overview**
This project analyzes historical **U.S. gasoline and diesel retail prices (1995-2021)** to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and volatility. It also includes **forecasting models** to predict future fuel prices. The goal is to provide **actionable insights** for businesses, policymakers, and analysts.

## **Dataset**
- **Source:** [Kaggle - US Gasoline and Diesel Retail Prices (1995-2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mruanova/us-gasoline-and-diesel-retail-prices-19952021)
- **Contains:** Weekly U.S. retail prices for various fuel types (All Grades, Regular, Midgrade, Premium, Diesel).
- **Time Range:** 1995 - 2021

## **Key Insights**
- **Long-Term Trends:** Fuel prices exhibit an **upward trend** with periodic fluctuations.
- **Seasonal Variations:** Prices tend to **rise in summer months (Juneâ€“August)** due to increased travel demand.
- **Volatility Analysis:** Prices show significant instability during **economic crises and oil supply disruptions**.
- **Forecasting:** Future trends indicate a **continued increase in fuel prices**, necessitating strategic planning.
- **Top 5 Highest Fuel Price Years:** 2012, 2011, 2013, 2014, and 2008 were the most expensive years due to external market shocks.
